Control FLow & Conditional Operators ensure the correctness of your codes.

These two elements ensure that coding is easier and reliable/predictable. 

Python’s control flow determines how your code runs, based on conditions, loops, or errors.

Conditional operators compare the reliability of two values. they always return with true or false

Conditional operators respond to - greater than, equals to, less than, not equal to, and their derivatives. 

Control flow determines how code statements are executed based on conditions. 

COntrol flow includes - if, if else, for, while, break, continue, pass
